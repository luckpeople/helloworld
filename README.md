### Introduction
I am currently an associate professor in the School of Computer Science at the National University of Defense Technology, China. Now I am in University of California, Riverside for one-year visiting scholar till December 2017!
   
My main research interests are energy efficiency computing, including how to save energy consumption for GPU systems or CPU/GPU heterogenous systems, how to utilize DVFS, undervolting or overclocking techniques to save more energy consumption on CPU, GPU or CPU/GPU heterogenous systems, how to reduce power consumption of HPC interconnection networks utilizing router shutting off, how to analyze the communication characteristics for all kinds of large-scale scientific computing applications, and so on.

I also have great interests in CS education. Now I am focusing on how to integrate  Parallel Computational Thinking Ideas to our Introduction to Parallel Programming Courses ! Please see Here  for more details about PCT! 

Welcome to contact me if you have some ideas about the above researches!
